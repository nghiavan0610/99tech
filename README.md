## Problem 4

Please find the README.md in the /problem4 folder for more details.

## Problem 5

I have used two frameworks for this task:

- **NestJS (nest-product-api)**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
- **ExpressJS (express-product-api)**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

### API Testing

I have deployed my application, and you can use the following API for testing:

- **API**: [Product API](https://99tech-product-api.benlab.site)
- **Postman Collection**: See the attachment in the problem5/postman folder.

Alternatively, you can follow the instructions in the README.md files located in each product-api folder to run the applications locally.
