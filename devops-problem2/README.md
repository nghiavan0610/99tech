# Cost-Optimized Trading Platform Architecture Analysis

## 1. System Overview

### Global Edge Layer

- **Cloudflare Network**
  - Primary Role: Provides global DNS, CDN, DDoS protection, and load balancing
  - Benefits: Reduces latency, improves security, and provides the first line of defense
  - Alternative: AWS CloudFront + Shield + WAF, but Cloudflare offers better price-performance ratio

### CI/CD Pipeline

- **Multiple Options Available:**
  - Docker, Github Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Bitbucket Pipelines
  - Optional ArgoCD for GitOps and automated rollbacks
  - Optional Harbor for private container registry
  - Benefits: Flexibility in choosing tools based on team expertise
  - Alternative: AWS ECR, but self host container registry are more cost-effective
  - Alternative: AWS CodePipeline, but chosen solutions offer better developer experience and are more cost-effective

### Network Security Layer

- **Multi-layered approach:**
  - Self-hosted NGINX WAF for cost-effective application protection
  - Optional Route 53 for DNS management
  - VPN/Tunnel options for secure access
  - Security Groups for instance-level security
  - Alternative: AWS WAF, but self-hosted NGINX WAF provides better cost control

### Infrastructure Management

- **IAM & Access Control:**
  - Minimal IAM roles following principle of least privilege
  - Optional CloudTrail for security/audit logging of all AWS API calls
  - Alternative: Third-party IAM solutions, but native AWS IAM is sufficient and cost-effective
  - Alternative: Keycloak/OpenLDAP: Provides identity management for your applications and infrastructure

### VPC Architecture

- **Cost-optimized network design:**
  - VPC & Public + Private subnets for security
  - NAT Gateway for outbound traffic
  - Security Groups without NACLs for simplicity
  - Alternative: AWS Transit Gateway setup, but current design is sufficient for initial scale

## 2. Core Components

### Compute Infrastructure

- **Kubernetes-based deployment:**
  - Self-managed Kubernetes with Rancher
  - Flexible Spot + Spot Fleet, On-Demand instances for cost optimization
  - Multi-cluster setup (Production, Staging, Dev)
  - Alternative: EKS, but self-managed K8s offers better cost control
  - Alternative: k8s Management - k9s, lens but Rancher is good for enterprise environments, multi-cluster management, and role-based access control

### Microservices Architecture

- **Key Services:**
  1. API Gateway Service: Entry point for all API requests
  2. User Service: Authentication and user management
  3. Market Data Service: Real-time market data via WebSocket
  4. Order Service: Trading API endpoints
  5. Matching Engine: Order book management
  6. Wallet Service: Balance management
  - Alternative: Monolithic architecture, but microservices offer better scalability

### Data Services

- **Distributed Data Storage:**
  1. NoSQL Cluster (MongoDB/ScyllaDB)
     - Use: High-throughput operations, flexible schema
     - Alternative: DynamoDB could be a better choice despite higher costs because:
       - It reduces operational overhead (backups, patching, high availability)
       - Offers better reliability guarantees
       - Provides read replicas and easier scaling
       - Simplifies disaster recovery
  2. Aurora RDS (PostgreSQL)
     - Use: ACID-compliant transactions
     - Alternative: Self-host Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, but RDS could be a better choice despite higher costs because:
       - It reduces operational overhead (backups, patching, high availability)
       - Offers better reliability guarantees
       - Provides read replicas and easier scaling
       - Simplifies disaster recovery
  3. Redis Caching
     - Use: High-speed data access, session management
     - Alternative: Memcached, but Redis offers more features
  4. Object Storage (R2)
     - Use: Static content, backups
     - Alternative: S3, MinIO
     - Could use Cloudflare R2 for better cost because R2 have no egress fees (pay only for storage & operations), with S3 charges for storage + egress bandwidth
  5. Message Broker (Kafka/RabbitMQ)
     - Use: Async communication, event streaming
     - Alternative: AWS MSK, but self-hosted offers better cost control
     - Alternative: Redis Queue
       - Use Redis Queue if you need a simple, fast, in-memory queue for short-lived tasks or real-time processing
       - Use Kafka if you need high-throughput event streaming, logs, analytics, or distributed systems that process massive amounts of events
       - Use RabbitMQ if you need a reliable message broker for background jobs, task queues, or request-response patterns

## 3. Monitoring & Observability

### Comprehensive Monitoring Stack:

1. **Metrics Stack:**

   - Grafana for visualization
   - Prometheus for metrics collection
   - Thanos for long-term storage
   - Alternative: CloudWatch, but current stack offers better features/cost ratio

2. **Logging/Tracing:**

   - OpenTelemetry for instrumentation
   - Jaeger for distributed tracing
   - Loki for log aggregation
   - Alternative: AWS X-Ray, but chosen stack provides better visibility

3. **Error Tracking:**
   - Sentry for error monitoring
   - Telegram for alerts
   - Alternative: CloudWatch Alerts, but current setup offers better developer experience
